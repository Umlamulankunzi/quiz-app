   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up the database**:
   - For development, SQLite is configured by default.
   - For production, configure MySQL in `settings.py`.

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Create a superuser**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

7. **Access the application**:
   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000/`.

## Usage

### User Roles

- **Admin**: Can manage all users and quizzes.
- **Quiz Master**: Can create, update, and manage their own quizzes. Requires Admin approval for publication.
- **Regular User**: Can take quizzes and view leaderboards.
- **Developer**: Can access the quiz API.

### Frontend

- **Homepage**: Introduction to the platform and a call to action.
- **Quizzes**: Browse and take quizzes on various subjects.
- **Dashboards**: Personalized dashboards for users and quiz masters.
- **About**: Information about the website and website developers.
- **Contact**: Provides a platform to contact website admins.
- **Api-info**: Get information on the REST API.

### Developer API

- **Endpoint**: `/api/v1/`
- **Authentication**: Developers and Admins can access the API with custom authentication.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive API docs are available [here](#).

## API Documentation

Developers can interact with Quiz Wiz's API to access quiz data, create new quizzes, and more. The API requires authentication based on the `is_developer` or `is_admin` user roles.

### Available Endpoints

- **List Quizzes**: `GET /api/quizzes/`
- **Quiz Detail**: `GET /api/quizzes/<id>/`
- **Create Quiz**: `POST /api/quizzes/`
- **Update Quiz**: `PATCH /api/quizzes/<id>/`
- **Delete Quiz**: `DELETE /api/quizzes/<id>/`

Refer to the [API documentation](#) for detailed information.

## Custom Authentication

The API access is restricted to users with the `is_developer` or `is_admin` roles. A custom permission class, `IsDeveloperOrAdmin`, is implemented to ensure secure access to API endpoints.

## Deployment

### Production

For deployment,I plan to deploy on platforms like Railway or PythonAnywhere, I plan to follow these steps:

1. **Configure production settings**:
   - Set `DEBUG = False` in `settings.py`.
   - Configure allowed hosts and database settings for MySQL.

2. **Deploy the application**:
   - Use Git to push to your hosting service.
   - Set up environment variables as needed.

3. **Apply migrations**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

4. **Collect static files**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py collectstatic
